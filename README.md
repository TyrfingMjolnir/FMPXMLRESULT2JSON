FMPXMLRESULT2JSON
=================

As I see more and more people using AngularJS, I believe some people might benefit from
releasing this stylesheet from 2008, namely: fmpxmlresult2json.xslt

This simple "flat file"-export( only one level of tables, does not exceed the use of
.csv/.tab files ) is excelent for newsfeeds and/or productlist, but falls short of a
full product description.

========================================================================================

For some reason I m not able to get this one to work( as a stylesheet for FileMaker export, i e ):
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TyrfingMjolnir/FMPXMLRESULT2JSON/master/fmpxmlresult2json.xslt
for the stylesheet.
