FMPXMLRESULT2JSON
=================

As I see more and more people using AngularJS, I thought it was some people might benefit from me releasing this stylesheet from 2008, namely: fmpxmlresult2json.xslt

This simple "flat file"-export( only one level of tables, does not exceed the use of .csv/.tab files ) is excelent for newsfeeds and/or productlist, but falls short of a full product description.

If you only want to use this file as is, and your machines are always online, I do recommend using the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TyrfingMjolnir/FMPXMLRESULT2JSON/master/fmpxmlresult2json.xslt for the stylesheet.
